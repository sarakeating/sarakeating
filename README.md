- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarakeating
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development and dealing with lots of data (very basic data science maybe?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot! I'm very new to this, but specifically some things about pygame, pandas, matplotlib, and starting to get into basic javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects, so feel free to ask if you have one in mind!
- 📫 How to reach me ... at my email is best: sjkeatingc@gmail.com
